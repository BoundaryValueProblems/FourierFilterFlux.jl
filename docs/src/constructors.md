# Built-in constructors #
This section details the filter constructors included by default. These are
built off of the [Wavelets](https://github.com/JuliaDSP/Wavelets.jl) and
[Shearlab](https://github.com/arsenal9971/Shearlab.jl) packages for the 1D and
2D constructors respectively.

## 1D methods ##
